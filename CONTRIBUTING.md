# Contributing to Hacktoberfest'24 Official Website Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Hacktoberfest'24 Official Website repository! We are thrilled to have you as part of this collaborative effort led by **Google Developer Groups on Campus Graphic Era University** and our partner **Vaunt.dev**.

This repository offers a unique **2-Tier Contribution System**, which provides flexibility to contribute to our core repository or any open-source project of your choice.

---

## 1. Contribution Tiers

### Tier 1: Contribute to the Core Repository
For this tier, contributors work directly on the core repository of the Hacktoberfest event. Here's how to get started:

- **Find an Issue**: Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues) and search for issues with `[ISSUE]` in the title.
  - Maintainers will regularly update and label issues with `[ISSUE]`. You can also create a new issue with `[ISSUE]` in the title if you find a bug or a feature request.
  
- **Work on the Issue**: Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, please comment on it to inform the maintainers that you're taking it up.

- **Submit a Pull Request**: After you've implemented the fix or feature, submit a pull request using the following naming convention:
  ```
  pr-add-<name>-<PR number>
  ```
  Example: `pr-add-johndoe-123`

### Tier 2: Contribute to External Repositories
In this tier, participants contribute to **ANY external repository** they are interested in. Follow these steps:

1. **Find an External Repository**: Choose any repository of your choice to contribute to.

2. **Get a Pull Request Merged**: Work on an issue or feature in the external repository and get your pull request merged successfully.

3. **Create an Issue in Our Repository**: 
    - Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues) in this repository.
    - Create an issue titled `[PR EXTERNAL] <your name>`.
    - In the issue, provide the following information:
        - Your Name
        - GitHub Username
        - PR Number
        - Link to the PR
        - A brief description of your contribution.

4. **Get Approval**: Our maintainers will verify your external contribution. Once it's approved, they will instruct you to:
    - Create a pull request against your own issue.
    - Update the `participants/participants.js` file (explained below).

## 2. Updating the Participants Log

After your contribution is verified, you’ll need to update the `participants/participants.js` file with your details to be featured in the leaderboard. The format is as follows:

```js
{
    id: "<incremental id>",
    name: "<Your Name>",
    university: "<Your University>",
    img: <your image variable>,
    pr: [<PR number>],
    prLink: ['<PR link>'],
},
```

### Example:
```js
{
    id: "1",
    name: "Ayush Chamoli",
    university: "Graphic Era University",
    img: ayush, // You can provide your image if available
    pr: [1],
    prLink: ['#link1'],
},
```

### **How to Add Your Image**

To include your image in the `participants/participants.js` file, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Image**: 
   - Ensure your image is square (1:1 aspect ratio) and in **JPG** or **PNG** format.
   
2. **Place Your Image in the Folder**: 
   - Save your image in the `participants/avatars/img/` folder.
   
3. **Import the Image**: 
   - After placing your image in the `img/` folder, go to the `index.js` file in the `participants/avatars/` folder.
   - Import your image using the following format:
     ```js
     import <yourImageName> from './img/<yourImageName>.jpg (or .png)';
     ```

   Example:
   ```js
   import ayush from './img/ayush.jpg';
   ```
4. **Export the Image**: 
   - Now, export the image from the same `index.js` file by adding the following line:
     ```js
     export {
       <yourImageName>,
     };
     ```

   Example:
   ```js
   export {
       ayush,
   };
   ```

5. **Update the `participants.js` File**:
   - In the `participants/participants.js` file, set the `img` field to your image variable (which you imported and exported in the steps above). 

Once done, your image will be displayed on the leaderboard along with your contribution details.
